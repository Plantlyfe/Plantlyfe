## Intro

I have over eight years of experience in a fast paced environment in the telecommunications industry. With additional experience in functioning as a point of escalation for customers and internal management while troubleshooting services for our clients. I have built a home lab environment simulating an enterprise network to demonstrate my understanding of Wiring, DNS, DHCP, TCP/IP, Routing protocols and concepts (Ex. OSPF), Virtualization/VMs, Active Directory, Networking Configuration & Equipment, and more. I have a Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Certification and I am currently studying for the Security+ certification. And In the future I am hoping to implement SIEM Tools & Technologies, Ansible Playbook and Network Automation using Python along with configuring and maintaining additional Linux systems into my lab environment.

In my current role I exercise a calculated and methodical approach to problem-solving. I am experienced in troubleshooting methodologies with the proven ability to provide excellent customer service and problem ownership. While I am independently motivated, I appreciate collective efforts and collaborate productively within group settings.
