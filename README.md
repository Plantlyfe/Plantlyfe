## Info

I have over eight years of experience working in a fast paced, 24/7, deadline driven environment in the telecommunications industry. With additional experience in functioning as a point of escalation for customers and internal management while troubleshooting services for our clients. I have been responsible to develop, mentor, and lead a team of 8-11 individuals who provide troubleshooting support for clients at hundreds of locations on a daily basis around the country with tight SLAs.

In my current role I exercise a calculated and methodical approach to problem-solving. I am experienced in troubleshooting methodologies with the proven ability to provide excellent customer service and problem ownership. While I am independently motivated, I appreciate collective efforts and collaborate productively within group settings. I enjoy figuring out ways to automate and track tasks we commonly complete manually.

I have a Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Certification and I am currently studying for the Security+ certification. In the future I am hoping to create an Ansible Playbook for Network Automation using Python. Implement AI-driven network management systems. Write Scripts to automate repetitive Active Directory tasks with PowerShell, Expand Linux Implementation and practice BGP configuration, route optimization, and policy management, to effectively manage network traffic in service provider environments. Configure and maintain additional Linux systems into my lab environment.


## Overview

The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase how I have designed, deployed, and maintained a scalable LAN network for multiple devices/users to simulate an enterprise network using a variety of network devices such as a Cisco router, Cisco switch, Access Point and a Proxmox virtualization server to demonstrate my understanding of Wiring, Network Configuration & Monitoring, DNS, DHCP, Routing Protocols, ACL/firewall rules & Active Directory. Configured inter-VLAN routing with ROAS. Implemented VLAN segmentation, and optimized Layer 2/3 switching for security and performance such as SNMPv3 for secure enterprise-leve network monitoring. And setup VPN & Remote Access for secure remote administration.
