## Info
I have  over eight years in telecommunications, a Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification, and hands-on experience in problem solving in an enterprise environment. In my current role I lead a team of 8–11 analysts troubleshooting service issues across hundreds of client locations while maintaining strict SLAs in a high-pressure, deadline-driven environment.

I have a passion for automation and process optimization. Figuring out ways to auotmate tasks we usually would complete manually. I implemented workflow automation using Power Automate, including developing a substitute ticketing system for our department to use during company system outages. This reduced manual work, increased accountability, and improved visibility for daily assignments. Ensuring smooth operations for our clients.

I thrive in both independent problem-solving and collaborative team environments, always looking for ways to enhance efficiency, security, and performance. 

I have built a homelab replicating enterprise networks. This hands-on approach has allowed me to troubleshoot real-world scenarios, reinforcing my ability to support and optimize network infrastructures. My CCNA certification has solidified my networking expertise, and I’m currently pursuing the CompTia Security+ certification to expand my skill set. Additionally, I’m exploring SIEM tools, Python for network automation, and BGP configuration to further enhance my capabilities.


## Overview

The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase how I have designed, deployed, and maintained a scalable LAN network for multiple devices/users to simulate an enterprise network using a variety of network devices such as a Cisco router, Cisco switch, Access Point and a Proxmox virtualization server to demonstrate my understanding of Wiring, Network Configuration & Monitoring, VLANs, DHCP, Routing Protocols, ACL/firewall rules & Active Directory. Configured inter-VLAN routing with ROAS. Implemented VLAN segmentation, and optimized Layer 2/3 switching for security and performance such as SNMPv3 for secure enterprise-leve network monitoring. And setup VPN & Remote Access for secure remote administration.
